# card-guessing-game

it's a simple game where you are shown a deck of cards for a split second then you have to guess the selected one.

the game has four difficulty modes:

(Child's play || Easy || Medium || Legend's play) -
with the former being a 2*2 grid and latter all the way to 5*5.

there are 15 fruit levels and 15 animal levels adding up to 30 main levels upon completing which you'll be rewarded ;)

you can keep playing after level 30 if you want to (it gets harder btw)


Technologies used include:
1.HTML 
2.CSS/SCSS 
3.JavaScript 
4.some 3rd party libraries (gsap, confetti.js) 


Enjoy :))
